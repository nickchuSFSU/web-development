## Purpose of Repository

This repository will be used to the source code for all three assignments. You will be expected for each assignment to:

1. Create a new branch for each new assignment. The name of the branch will be chosen by you but should be related to the assignment.
2. Complete all the requirements for each assignment.
3. Push all completed code to the branch.
4. Merge completed code back into the master branch.

This is something you will be doing for every assignment.
